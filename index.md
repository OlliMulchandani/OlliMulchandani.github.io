My name is Olli Mulchandani (not the only mention of my name on this site as I'm sure you've seen by now), and I'm a senior graduating from Yorktown High School in Arlington, Virginia. I'll be attending the University of Virginia in the fall to study computer science, and I wanted to build this site as a directory for all things related to me.

Some of my interests include computer science (evidently), soccer, Spanish, going to the gym, listening to music, and traveling. If you want to learn about my involvement in youth soccer, [here is an article about me](http://www.arlingtonsoccer.com/players-first-leadership-council-spotlight-olli-mulchandani) written by Arlington Soccer Association.
