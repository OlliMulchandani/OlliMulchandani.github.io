  <p>My name is Olli Mulchandani, and I'm a first-year student at the University of Virginia studying computer science. This site is a directory for all things related to me.</p>
  
  <p>Some of my interests include computer science (evidently), soccer, Spanish, going to the gym, tennis, snowboarding, and traveling (including solo travel). If you want to learn a little bit about my involvement in youth soccer, <a href="http://www.arlingtonsoccer.com/players-first-leadership-council-spotlight-olli-mulchandani">here is an article about me</a> written by Arlington Soccer Association.</p>
  
  <p>I'm a <b>massive</b> Manchester City fan, so that tends to be the focus of a lot of the travel I've done and plan to do. To the right is a picture of me at my first game last March.</p>
