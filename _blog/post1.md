Coming home from college for Thanksgiving break, I paused and looked up and back for the first time in what felt like forever. My life really has changed tremendously over the past many months. Inspired by my mother and her blog, [Snowflakes in January](https://snowflakesinjanuary.com), I've decided this should become the landing space for some of my more interesting ideas and experiences. Right now I'm lacking a clever and meaningful name for my blog like my mom has, but I'm sure that'll come to me over time.

Here you'll find detailed descriptions of some of the things I find most interesting, and I'm excited to see where I take this. I hope to write about all of my travels, some of the books and philosophies I find most thought-provoking, the odd incredible meal I'll have and just *need* to share, and also about some of the great people in my life.

Writing has never been my strongest attribute, but it's absolutely something I aspire to practice, improve, and hopefully learn to enjoy. This blog will hopefully represent some character development from the cynical Olli who interpreted all the imperfect grades and points off on his essays throughout middle and high school as a giant middle finger that just screamed "Stick to STEM!" And while I'm definitely branching out and exploring writing with this experiment, I'm still sticking to my tech-nerdy roots as I'm probably the only person on the planet who writes his blog posts in raw markdown files as opposed to Google Docs or Word like a normal person.
