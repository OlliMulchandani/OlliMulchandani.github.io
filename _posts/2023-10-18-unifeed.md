---

UniFeed is an app currently being designed as the ultimate course scheduling headache solution by a team of 6 developers, made up of UVA students and alumni, including myself.

While UniFeed is currently available on the iOS App Store and Google Play Store as an *all-in-one college social media platform to promote club events, find out what is going on campus, and join group chats with those in your classes* with 600+ registered users, the app is going to see some major changes over the coming months. 

Current UniFeed:

  <img src="/assets/images/unifeed2.jpeg" width="150" height="325"/>
  <img src="/assets/images/unifeed3.jpeg" width="150" height="325"/>
</div>
